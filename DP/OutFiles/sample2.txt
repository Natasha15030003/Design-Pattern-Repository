 A trick to help with debugging
 Constructor
 turn off debugging
 Default constructor
 Invokes 2 parameter Point2D constructor
 Note that a this() invocation must be the BEGINNING of
 statement body of constructor
 Another consructor
 a better method would be to replace the above code with
    this (pt.getX(), pt.getY());
 especially since the above code does not initialize the
 variable debug.  This way we are reusing code that is already
 working.
 print the debugging string only if the "debug"
 data member is true
 check out the use of dprint()
 The X and Y coordinates of the point--instance variables
